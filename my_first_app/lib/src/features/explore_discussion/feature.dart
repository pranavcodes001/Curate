// Explore Discussion feature public surface
// Responsibility: Provide contracts and entry points for opt-in AI exploration flows.
// Important: This feature should be opt-in and guided (no free-form chatbot style UX),
// and it should remain isolated from other parts of the app.

// Implementation notes for the future:
// - Provide a controller that orchestrates guided questions and summary consumption.
// - Keep all AI-related logic contained here and gate it behind explicit user consent.
