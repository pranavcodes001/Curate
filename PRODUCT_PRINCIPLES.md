# Product Principles: HN Clarity
## One Hard Product Principle
**We don’t answer questions. We explain discussions.**
If a feature violates this → **don’t build it.**
## Why this is better than “real chat”
A free-form AI chat is easy to build. A controlled intelligence product is hard—and valuable.
What we are designing:
- feels thoughtful
- feels safe
- feels intentional
- feels designed, not bolted on

Recruiters, investors, and users will notice this difference.

## App Identity
- **The App:** “A way to talk to tech discussions, not an AI.”
- **The AI:** A navigator, not a speaker.

That’s a much stronger identity.

## One Sentence Product Rule
**Users don’t ask questions — they choose perspectives.**

If we hold onto that, the product won’t drift.
